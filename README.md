Used MUI for styling and "recharts" to create a simple chart

Implemented bonus functionality:
 -  visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes (red, green colors)
 -  possibility to add/remove ticker from watching group
 -  additionally added chart for each ticker 

 Unfortunately failed with tets (didn`t find solution how to pass tests with react-router-dom)
